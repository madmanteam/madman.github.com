Recently I worked on a set of AWS Lambdaâ€™s that sends news notifications. I was trying to find a good API that would call news sources and found the News API [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/)

The News API is very easy to use in your programs. You just (1) create an account and then (2) use the generated key as part of your REST calls.

The site also has a lot of nice documentation so its easy to understand the endpoints [newsapi.org/docs](https://newsapi.org/docs)

They provide news from most of the major sources and a full list can be seen here [newsapi.org/sources](https://newsapi.org/sources)

You can even fine tune your query to a specific news source or topic. Here is a set of examples to [get started](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) 

The API Documentation includes support for most of the major languages used today.
